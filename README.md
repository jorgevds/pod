## pod

After a certain point in my autodidactic journey, I came to the realisation my portfolio doesn't really reflect what I'm capable of. Mostly, my ambition to be a programmer has blinded my short term vision and I've begone branching out to all sorts of more advanced technologies. What began by using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind in one project, quickly became learning about Postgres, GraphQL and Mikro-ORM. All the while my design skills sat idle.

But no more.

This project is the first of many more in design challenges I want to... challenge myself with (good one(shut up)). These sites/apps are in extension of my typical learning style, which is to learn by example and modify and change elements along the way. As with any tutorial, I'm very critical and like to add things in or change stuff up. Here that is no different.

### Design

The design of this project comes from Frondendmentor.io. More specifically, this is a premium challenge, which means you have to pay to access the assets. Instead of that, I tried to achieve a similar look without it.

It's pretty close to the challenge, but I didn't copy the design over wholesale. I mostly wanted to get the background image right, which took a little bit. In fairness, this challenge was ranked "beginner" and I finished this project in a couple of hours. But there were a couple things I wasn't sure how to do. I knew I needed some variation of:

And that's what most of the container elements got. I also needed some position: absolutes, and an input form with submit button. Other than that, I was mostly shooting in the dark as to the overlay and greenish effect the original design achieved. I deviated from the design quite a bit here and went for a much deeper green. I'm sure I could have achieved a closer result if I had used Photoshop, but I wanted to get close enough with CSS. The darker green was a design choice I went with. It came out looking pretty good, especially on mobile.


### Assets

The challenge also featured lots of little assets, like an svg in the corner of the screen to the right, a custom icon next to the h1 at the top, and some brand icons in the content box. I decided not to use most of these, obviously in the first place because I'm not a premium member and so don't have access to that work. But also because I looked up the Spotify branding and they explicitly stated not to present the logo in grayscale. I didn't want to deal with that so much; I really just wanted to practice styling and designing, so I left those assets behind. The image I got is also a different image, which is why I didn't go with the svg in the corner. I'm not sure it would really fit with a more JPEG-type file that has borders. 

What I did do, was make my own svg for both the title and the favicon. I used Illustrator to achieve this magnificent design:

###### Ain't she a beaut :heart_eyes:

I then had the favicon generator website I use add in the green color and border radius for the favicon. I did the same for the h1: added color and turned it into a circle.

###### Green :green_heart:

Nothing crazy, of course, but a little "Hello World!" in svg creation for me.

### What else

One neat thing I did do that involved some minor programming, was the copyright year. Now to be very very very clear, <b>I own no single copyright of this design: this was a design mockup by Frontendmentor.io and I do not own any rights.</b> But I did write a simple line of code to keep track of the universal year for me. 

![I hold no actual rights](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54646908/106106751-4baa7780-6146-11eb-8236-5241bebcd919.png)
###### I hold no actual rights :open_file_folder:

Before I would just write the year and be done with it, but this seems like a more elegant and simple solution. 

Please don't sue.

### What else I can do

There's not much more I could do here. I set out to challenge myself, I achieved decent results in a good timeframe, and I'm already working on the next one. Of course, any design can be changed, updated, and improved, and I'm by no means an expert. But for this one, being that it's such a minimal project, I don't think I'll be revisiting it too much. Maybe I'll change a color here and there, or update a font or something. I did read <i>Refactoring UI</i> after this project after all.
